# Short_CSS_Framework_by_Jonathan_hollander

CREATE A Small  FRAMEWORK -  a CSS file with rules for font-size, font-family:

Goals:

1. a header that will be fixed at the top even if the content is too big
2. the menu (we will assume that it will have 4 items the most) - should be horizontal in desktop and vertical when in mobile devices
3. links (SHOWS UP in the content area, not in the navigation), 
  a. a link to a pdf file, you will present a pdf logo right after the link, 
  b. when it's a link to an html or htm page, you will present the browser logo,
  c. when it's a link to anything else, you will present the interrogation mark
